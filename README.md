# SIMON-GAME

This is a simple Memory Game, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript along wih Jquery.

There are 2 arrays going on simultaneously, one for storing the required pattern, and one which user has to enter.

If the entered pattern is correct, the game progresses, else it is over.

Thanks for reading through this.
